Type Casting:
process of conversion from one datatype to another.

two types:
1) Implicit type conversion: python automatically converts
This process doesn't need any user involvement

2) Explicit type conversion:(TypeCasting) because the user cast or changes the datatype of the object
user has to change the datatype of an object to the required datatype
we use predefined functions:
int()
float()
str()
